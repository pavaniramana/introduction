    <dl>
        <dt>Single Page Applications</dt>
        <dd>Single page Application is an Application of any web application when user select any option from the nav bar or click on any button, then the page is updated without reloading the page is SPA.
             When we are creating React application by using CRA it must be the SPA.
            SPA load faster.SPA is strongly decoupled, meaning that front-end and back-end are separate.

    <dl>
        <dt>Multi Page Applications</dt>
        <dd>Multi page Application is an Application of any web application when user select any option from the nav bar or click on any button, then the page is updated with reloading the page is MPA.
            MPA is slower as the browser must reload the entire page from scratch whenever the user wants to access new data or moves to a different part of the website.
            In MPAs, front-end and back-end are more interdependent.
            You can create as many pages as required, and you can include as much information on a page as you need without any limits
